1. I tried to set the root page as '/' by using ProtectRoute to force user to login. 
However, it ran into an infinite loop, where it kept looping within frontend 
route '/' and '/login' routes. 
2. I created a demo login in session_form, and when I tried Demo Login from the 
root "/", error showed up, and state looked strange; yet, it could redirect to 
greeting page.
