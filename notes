1. I tried to set the root page as '/' by using ProtectRoute to force user to login. 
However, it ran into an infinite loop, where it kept looping within frontend 
route '/' and '/login' routes. 
2. I created a demo login in session_form, and when I tried Demo Login from the 
root "/", error showed up, and state looked strange; yet, it could redirect to 
greeting page.
3. I forgot to add "bio" column in users model, and I made new migration adding 
it to users table. And did json.extract! on bio column. Somehow, it still worked
locally, but in heroku, website broke down as heroku logs said, "bio" undefined
